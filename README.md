# Challenge Summary

This program is powerful enough to process data for any election. A valuable tool to have in helping to ensure the integrity of elections. This script was created to intake CSV files and would need to be modified if processing a difference file type. It could also be modified if further information like election results by county were desired, instead of simply the overall result.
